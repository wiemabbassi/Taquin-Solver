# Taquin-Solver
A python implementation of the 8-puzzle solver using Depth-First Search (DFS) and Depth-Limited Search (DLS) algorithms. The solution includes a graphical interface built with Pygame to visualize the puzzle states and the steps taken to reach the solution. The goal is to rearrange the tiles to match the final state of the puzzle.
